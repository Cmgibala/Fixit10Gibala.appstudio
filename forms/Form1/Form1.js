/*

So do the following:
a.	copy the code part in the event  handler you want to redo: 
if (inptName.value == "Bob") 
lblWelcome.value = `Welcome Bob!`
else 
lblWelcome.value = `Please re-enter your name.`
b.	delete all the event listener and handler code for that event.  
c.	create a new event listener (eg. right-click on the button, pick 'onclick' event)
d.	paste the code you copied into the new event handler
e.	** you will also have to change the names of controls in the code in the new form to match the new names given by appStudio (like btnSubmit11). 
Scenario: 
Show them the current customer names in a textarea control. Use an input control to get the customer name they want to delete. Check to make sure the customer being deleted is actually in the database before you try to delete it. After the delete, show the remaining customer names in the textarea control.
